      <p>Flamingos are famous for their bright pink feathers,
    stilt-like legs, and S-shaped neck. When a flamingo
    spots potential dinner—favorite foods include shrimp,
    snails, and plantlike water organisms called algae—it
    plunges its head into the water, twists it upside down,
    and scoops the fish using its upper beak like a shovel.
    They are able to "run" on water, thanks to their webbed
    feet, to gain speed before lifting up into the sky.
      <br>Flamingos build nests that look like mounds of mud
    along waterways. At the top of the mound, in a shallow
    hole, the female lays one egg. The parents take turns
    sitting on the egg to keep it warm. After about 30 days,
    the egg hatches. Flamingo young are born white, with soft,
    downy feathers and a straight bill. The bill gradually curves
    downward as the flamingo matures. Both parents take care of
    the newborn flamingo, feeding it a fluid produced in their
   digestive systems. The young leave the nest after about
   five days to join other young flamingos in small groups,
   returning to the parents for food. The parents identify their
 chick by its voice. After about three weeks, the adults herd
 young flamingos into large groups called crèches where they start
 to look for food on their own.
